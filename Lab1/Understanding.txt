In Lab1 HandsOn:

Account 1 amount is displayed without adding any interest rate on the given amount;

On Account 2 amount is displayed after adding the interest of 8.5% on the given amount;

AccManager2 class is makes use of the getters and setter methods defined in the account class,
while AccManager1 class is accesses the data members directly and hence there is no calculation of the interest.

As we understand that it's always a better way to use get and set the data members value through functions and not directly
